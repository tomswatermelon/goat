# Goat

Hi There!

This is just another front-end development setup, simple and fast, it might not be lightweight enough, but it gets the job done and saves your time. Riding this goat, you will be implementing these things into your workflow:

- Gulp
- Sass
- Livereload

So, you will be writing sass and page will be reloaded upon your saving action.

## Dependencies

Run `npm install` to install these dependencies

- gulp
- gulp-clean-css
- gulp-concat
- gulp-concat-css
- gulp-autoprefixer
- gulp-imagemin
- gulp-jshint
- gulp-livereload
- gulp-notify
- gulp-plumber
- gulp-sass
- gulp-uglify
- jshint


## Usage

Download, rename and run `gulp` in root folder.

Write your scripts in src folder, and visit dist/{page name}.html folder in browser.

### Livereload

Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei to install chrome plugin for livereloading. Once `gulp` is running, visit your page and switch on the livereload extension in chrome.
